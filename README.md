This is a site where users can stream to their viewers. Once the streamer is logined in they will be able to create, edit, and start their stream. For an example I used [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to record my desktop and send to this site. 

Client: Launches the site.  
Server: JSON file that holds streams that have already been created.  
rtmpserver: What user will connect to, to pass their stream data to the site.  

This site uses react-router-dom to navigate from one webpage to another.
